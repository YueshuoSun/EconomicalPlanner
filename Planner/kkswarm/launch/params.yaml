# Controller gains for trajectory tracking
k_x: 2.0      # Proportional gain for longitudinal error (remains unchanged)
k_y: 5.0      # Increased from 5.0 for much stronger lateral correction
k_theta: 1.5  # Increased from 1.5 for faster and more precise heading correction

# Physical limits of the robot (remains unchanged)
